00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, hi there! In this video we're going to do part three of the Toic Listening Test.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First I'll give you some tips on getting a high score at the test, and then after that we'll do a practice run of the test together.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, let's do it!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Tip one. Study the questions and answers before listening to the conversation.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Before the conversation is played, there are instructions.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Take advantage of this time to read each question and four answers.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Doing this will give you some idea of what the conversation is about.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
While the audio is playing, you need to focus on listening to choose the best answer and fill in the answer sheet.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
While the audio is reading each question, take advantage of this period of time to look at questions and answers for the next conversation.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You have about eight seconds to select the correct answer once the question is spoken.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Tip two. Common conversation topics.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For part three, there are some recurring conversation topics such as making an appointment, weather reports, business trips for a seminar or a conference, communication in business, and trade.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And there are recurring questions such as asking for a summary of the conversation.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
For example, what is the conversation about?

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is the topic of the conversation?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What are the speakers talking about? And who are the speakers talking about?

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And other questions ask for details.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For example, what problem does the woman have?

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What does the man suggest? Or what is John's job?

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Finally, there are inference questions.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
An inference question is a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Examples of inference questions are, what is the relationship between the two speakers?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What will the woman probably do next?

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And where is the conversation likely taking place?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Tip number three. Don't get confused.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You will hear a lot of information in each conversation.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But only one answer is correct. Other information is mentioned in order to distract or confuse test takers.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
To demonstrate, here's an example.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In order to make the Sunday edition, you'll give me your final draft on Friday afternoon.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Question. When does the man have to complete an assignment?

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
In this example, the speaker says, in order to make the Sunday edition, you'll give me your final draft on Friday afternoon.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Sunday and Friday are both mentioned in the statement, but the correct answer is B.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because the man has to complete his assignment on Friday afternoon.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, now let's take the test together.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Select the best response to each question. The conversations will be spoken only one time.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hello. I'm calling about a coffee machine I purchased from your website.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It stopped working even though I haven't had it for very long.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I expected it to last much longer than this.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'll warranty covers products for up to a year. Do you know when you bought it?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've had it for a little over a year, so the warranty is probably just expired. This is so disappointing.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, I'll tell you what we can do. Although we can't replace it since you're a valued customer, I can offer you a coupon for 40% off your next purchase.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Number 32. Why is the woman calling?

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Number 33. What does the man ask the woman about?

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Number 34. What does the man offer to do?

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Number 32. What does the man offer to do?

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The answer for question 32 is B. At the beginning of the phone call, the woman says that she's calling about her broken coffee machine.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't get distracted by the word warranty. The man and woman both say warranty, but it's not the reason for the call.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The answer for question 33 is D. A date of purchase. The man asks the woman,

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you know when you bought it? He's asking the woman when she bought the coffee machine.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The answer for question 34 is A. Provide a discount. The man offers the woman a coupon for 40% off her next purchase.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
40% off means a 40% discount. Again, don't get distracted by the word warranty.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, hi, Yolanda. I'm surprised to see you at the front desk this late. Don't you usually work at the hotel in the morning?

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Actually, I'm going to be working the evening shift for a while. I'm covering for a front desk supervisor who was just promoted,

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but only until the hotel hires a permanent replacement. Oh, so there's a front desk supervisor position open.

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've been looking for a chance to take on a managerial role. Are they still accepting applications?

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, and if you don't mind working evening hours, I think you have a good chance at the job.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'd contact the manager right now, though. She's starting interviews this week.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Number 35. Where do the speakers work?

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Number 36. What does the man ask about?

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Number 37. What does the woman say the man should be prepared to do?

65
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The answer for question 35 is A. The man and woman both say hotel and front desk, so they clearly work in a hotel.

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The answer for question 36 is C. The man asks, are they still accepting applications for the front desk supervisor position?

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There are three distractors here. Promotion, manager, and shifts. All of these words are said in the conversation, but have no connection to the man's question, so be careful.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The answer for question 37 is D. The woman says, if you don't mind working evening hours, I think you'd have a good chance at the job.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Here, the woman is stating that the man should be prepared to work evening hours if he plans to apply for the position.

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Have you two taken a look at the progress they've made upstairs on the office expansion? It looks great.

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I know. I can't believe it, and the offices up there have amazing views of the city.

73
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I wonder which division will move up there when it's finished. I heard it's the research department.

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ah, because they have the most people. Probably. I'd love to have an office on that floor though.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah. Well, the company must be making good money if they're adding that space. I think you're right there.

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Number 38. What is the conversation mainly about?

77
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Number 39. Why does the woman say, I can't believe it.

78
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Number 40. What do the men imply about the company?

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The correct answer for question 38 is A. This is a tricky question, because the word enlargement is not said in the conversation.

80
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
However, at the beginning of the conversation, one man asks the other two speakers about an office expansion.

81
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Expansion is a synonym for enlargement. The correct answer for question 39 is D. Here, you have to infer meaning from context and intonation.

82
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The woman is happily surprised by how much progress has been made on the office expansion.

83
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The answer for question 40 is C. One man says the company is making good money.

84
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Making good money is a common expression. It means to earn a large amount of money. So they are clearly implying that the company is in a good financial situation.

85
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation and list.

86
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Larry, we have a new graphic designer starting next month and we'll need to set her up with a laptop and extra monitor. Can you place orders for those?

87
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sure. You know our vendor has raised their prices, right?

88
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Really?

89
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes, I just looked at the catalog a few minutes ago and their current models are more expensive.

90
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Right. Well, our budget per work area is $1,000 maximum. So let's order the system with the largest screen that falls within that price.

91
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay, I'll take a look at the prices again and place the order.

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Number 41. What does the woman ask the man to do?

93
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Number 42. What problem does the man mention?

94
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Number 43. Look at the graphic. What size screen will the man order?

95
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The correct answer for question 41 is a. At the beginning of the conversation, the woman asks Larry to order a new laptop and monitor for a new graphic designer.

96
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't get distracted by the words vendor and laptop. These words are said in the conversation, but the woman does not ask Larry to find a new vendor or repair a laptop.

97
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The answer for question 42 is B. This is another question with synonyms. The word supplier isn't said in the conversation. However, Larry says that the vendor has raised their prices.

98
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Vendor is a synonym for supplier and of course, raise is a synonym for increase.

99
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The correct answer for question 43 is C. The woman says that the budget is $1,000. She asks Larry to order the system with the largest screen that falls within that price.

100
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Fall within means that Larry should order a system at or below $1,000. If you see a question about numbers in the test, make a note on your test paper of any numbers mentioned in the conversation

101
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
because they will probably be useful.

102
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Finished. Well done. I hope that video was helpful for you. If it was, please like and subscribe. I'll be making a part 4 video very soon for the TOEIC listening test.

103
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But for now, have a nice day.

104
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you
