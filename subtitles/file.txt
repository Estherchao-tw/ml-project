In Christ
I come before Your throne, Lord
My life is in Your hands
You reveal Your perfect will
I¡¦m willing to be Your glorious temple
The old has passed, the new has come
Because of Your love, I am reborn
It is no longer I who live
But Christ Who lives in me
If anyone is in Christ
He is a new creation
My life belongs to You
Because You gave Your life for me
I come before Your throne, Lord
My life is in Your hands
You reveal Your perfect will
I¡¦m willing to be Your glorious temple
The old has passed, the new has come
Because of Your love, I am reborn
It is no longer I who live
But Christ Who lives in me
If anyone is in Christ
He is a new creation
My life belongs to You
Because You gave Your life for me
The old things have passed
The new has come
The old things have passed
The new has come
The old things have passed
The new has come
The old things have passed
The new has come
If anyone is in Christ
He is a new creation
My life belongs to You
Because You gave Your life for me
