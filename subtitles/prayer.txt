thank you
today I simply want to share with you a
Psalm that has really touched me
at times when I'm overwhelmed and I want
to pray but I can't find the words to
speak
I simply read this Psalm and I offer it
as a prayer to the Lord
and as I read it I want you to keep
something in mind
David mentions enemies however when I
applied this Psalm to my life the
enemies I'm talking about are not
physical enemies
but rather I sometimes have to face an
enemy called discouragement
sometimes it's called anxiety or worry
these are all enemies
so for the next few moments
as I read this precious Psalm from the
word of God
I encourage you to open up your heart to
the Lord
and cast all your burdens on him
Psalm 27 verses 1 through 14.
the Lord is my light and my salvation
so why should I be afraid
the Lord is my Fortress protecting me
from danger
so why should I tremble when evil people
come to devour me when my enemies and
foes attack me they will stumble and
fall though a mighty Army surrounds me
my heart will not be afraid
even if I am attacked
I will remain confident
the one thing I ask of the Lord
the thing I seek most is to live in the
house of the Lord all the days of my
life delighting in the Lord's
Perfections and meditating in his Temple
for he will conceal me there when
troubles come
he will hide me in his Sanctuary he will
place me Out Of Reach on a high Rock
then I will hold my head high above my
enemies who surround me
at his Sanctuary I will offer sacrifices
with shouts of joy
singing and praising the Lord with music
hear me as I pray O Lord be merciful and
answer me
my heart has heard you say come and talk
with me
and my heart responds Lord I am coming
do not turn your back on me
do not reject your servant and anger you
have always been my helper
don't leave me alone now
don't abandon me o God of my salvation
even if my father and mother abandoned
me
the Lord will hold me close
teach me how to live O Lord
lead me along the right path for my
enemies are waiting for me
do not let me fall into their hands for
they accuse me of things I've never done
with every breath they threaten me with
violence
yet I am confident I will see the Lord's
goodness while I am here in the land of
the living
wait patiently for the Lord be brave and
courageous yes wait patiently for the
Lord
now let us pray
my Lord my savior
Jesus Christ of Nazareth
the one and only son of the Living God
King Jesus you are my light and my
salvation
and because of that Whom Shall I Fear
what shall I be afraid of
when Jesus Christ Our Lord is our refuge
and the Fortress of Our Lives Whom Shall
We dread
if God is for us who can be against us
no one because we serve an almighty
all-powerful all-conquering God
even if the wicked come up against us we
will not fear
even if an Army encamps against us our
hearts will not fear because Jesus
Christ holds all power
Lord You're The One who has the final
say
father my prayer is what your word says
in Psalm 27 verse 4. one thing I have
asked of the Lord
and that I will seek
that I may dwell in the house of the
Lord in his presence all the days of my
life to gaze upon the beauty the
delightful loveliness and Majestic
Grandeur of the Lord
and to meditate in his Temple
Lord I trust you because in the day of
trouble you will be my shelter
you will always be my Hiding Place
you will lift me up on a rock
because of this I will sing praises to
your name O Lord
your word in Psalm 95 verses 1 through
7. it says come let us sing for Joy to
the Lord
let us shout aloud to the rock of our
salvation
let us come before him with Thanksgiving
and extol him with music and song
for the Lord is the great God the great
king above all gods in his hand are the
depths of the earth and the mountain
peaks belong to him
the sea is his for he made it and His
Hands formed the dry land
come let us Bow Down In Worship let us
kneel before the Lord our maker for he
is our God
and we are the people of his pasture the
flock under his care
Lord Jesus we thank you for bringing us
out of the darkness and we thank you for
shining your light on our hearts
we can now declare that Jesus Christ is
the way the truth and the life
we were once lost
but you have now called us to be yours
may your light shine within our lives
Lord
let your light be seen in our character
let your light be seen in our words and
in our actions
father each and every day
may it be all about you
may we live to exalt you may we live to
praise you and worship you because you
are
an awesome God you are the almighty God
Lord Jesus be praised
let your light shine and be seen in how
I walk in this life
and how I conduct myself
thank you for your word Dear God
for it says in Micah chapter 7 verse 8.
do not rejoice over me my enemy when I
fall
I will arise when I sit in darkness the
Lord will be a light to me
I pray that in all I do
may I reflect your love may I reflect
your mercy to those around me
thank you Lord
for inviting me to be a part of your
plan
in Jesus name I pray
amen

for a moment
I want to encourage you to meditate on
Psalm 27 today
in its entirety Psalm 27
encapsulates David's deep trust in God's
protection guidance and presence
and I believe that this is a passage
that invites us to place our confidence
in God
even in the face of challenges and to
seek him with all our heart
just as David found comfort and courage
in his relationship with God we too can
draw strength from our faith in the
midst of life's trials
and so Psalm chapter 27. verse 1.
the Lord is my light and my salvation
Whom Shall I Fear
the Lord is the stronghold of my life of
whom shall I be afraid
David Begins by proclaiming his
unwavering trust in God he uses powerful
metaphors light and salvation to convey
that God illuminates his path and
rescues him from danger

leads him to ask a rhetorical question
if God is on his side
there is no one to fear
this verse sets the tone for an entire
Psalm emphasizing the strength of his
faith in God's guidance and refuge
verse 2.
when the wicked Advance against me to
devour me it is my enemies and my foes
who will stumble and fall
here David acknowledges the existence of
enemies and challenges that may come up
against him however
he firmly believes that God will cause
his enemies to stumble and fail in their
attempt to harm him
this verse reflects David's assurance
that God's power is greater than any
threat he faces
verse 3.
though an army besieged me my heart will
not fear the War break out against me
even then I will be confident
David's confidence in God's protection
continues to shine through he uses
strong imagery of an army besieging him
in war breaking out emphasizing the
severity of the challenges he may
encounter yet he remains unshaken in his
faith declaring that his heart will not
fear
he will maintain his confidence in God's
Deliverance
verse 4
one thing I ask from the Lord
this only do I seek that I may dwell in
the house of the Lord all the days of my
life to Gaze on the beauty of the Lord
and to seek him in his Temple
David expresses his deepest desire
to be in the presence of God he longs to
dwell in God's house not just for a
moment but for all the days of his life
this reflects David's thirst for
intimacy with God and His eagerness to
experience the beauty and wonder of
God's presence
verse 5.
for in the day of trouble he will keep
me safe in his dwelling he will hide me
in the shelter of his sacred tent and
set me high upon a rock
David reaffirms his trust in God's
protection and refuge he believes that
in times of trouble God will provide
safety and shelter
the image of being set high upon a rock
symbolizes being placed above danger and
adversity
verse 6.
then my head will be exalted above the
enemies who surround me at his sacred
tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy
I will sing and make music to the Lord

triumph over his enemies he anticipates
offering sacrifices and praises to God
with shouts of Joy celebrating God's

merciful to me and answer me
in this verse David shifts to a
heartfelt plea

compassion and desires and intimate
connection with him
verse 8.
my heart says of you seek his face your
face Lord I will seek

been my helper do not reject me or
forsake me God my savior

foes for false witnesses rise up against
me spouting malicious accusations

I remain confident of this
I will see the goodness of the Lord in
the land of the living

anticipates witnessing God's blessing
and Provisions in his current life not
just in the distant future
